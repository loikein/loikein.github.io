Although previous studies have estimated morbidity attributable to heat or cold across cities, we provide, to our knowledge, the first large-scale, population-wide assessment of the effect of extreme temperatures on excess emergency admissions in England and among vulnerable populations, who could be disproportionately affected.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this observational study, we combined all daily inpatient admissions during 2001–12 in England with meteorological data using inverse distance weighting. We exploited random daily variation in temperature experienced by hospitals and a 30-day lag period, using a distributed lag model with multiple fixed-effects controlling for seasonal factors, to examine interaction effects across diseases with age and the indices of multiple deprivation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We analysed 29 371 084 emergency admissions. A day with temperature above 30°C was associated with 3·5 more admissions per hospital (SE 0·45), relative to a 10–15°C day. This increased to 14·1 excess admissions per hospital (SE 5·56) over the following 30 days, generating 786 excess admissions across England per heatwave day. A day under –5°C generated 3·8 more admissions per hospital (SE 0·33), or 966 excess admissions across England. This increased to 62·3 admissions per hospital (SE 4·83) over the following 30 days. These effects were heterogeneous across age and deprivation level. Populations older than 74 years were up to 8 times more affected by extreme temperatures. Individuals living in low-employment and low-income areas were 2–10 times more likely to be admitted during a temperature shock. These results were statistically significant (p{\textless}0·0001) and passed several robustness and falsification tests.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine heterogeneous morbidity risks of temperature across an entire population using a robust, near-causal methodology. Population health is negatively affected by hot and cold temperature shocks, with older people and those living in low-employment and low-income areas disproportionately affected. Findings were unadjusted for pollution and possible individual protective behaviours, providing underestimated—yet policy-applicable—risks of temperature. A heterogeneous lag effect indicates the importance of considering vulnerable populations in policy making to ensure mitigation and resilience policies are not restricted to immediate temperature shocks only and are sensitive to vulnerable populations, mitigating inequalities in access to health care.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}British Academy and Imperial College Business School.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In 2006, the Massachusetts healthcare reform was introduced to mandate health insurance, extend eligibility of publicly subsidised health insurance, improve quality and access to care and develop preventive health services. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of expanding publicly subsidised health insurance through the Massachusetts reform on access to primary care, disease management and behavioural risk factors. Using cross-sectional data from the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 2001 to 2010 and exploiting the selective introduction of the healthcare reform, we assessed its impact on primary care access, behavioural risk factors, such as obesity, and receipt of diabetes management tests. We did so using a differences-in-differences methodology by comparing Massachusetts with other New England States for 131,002 adults under 300\% of the federal poverty level and by race/ethnicity within this group. Triple difference estimates were also conducted to control for potential within state time varying confounding factors. The results suggest that increasing publicly subsidised health insurance had a positive impact on primary care access for lower income adults, particularly those that are white. However, with the exception of improvements in alcohol consumption for one specific group (lower income whites) the reform had no effect on behaviour risk factors or diabetes disease management. The aims of the reform were to improve access to care and through this, behavioural risk factors and diabetes management. This study suggests that while access to care was increased, reducing risk factors attributed to health risky behaviour and diabetes cannot be sufficiently done simply by extending health insurance coverage and the provision of preventive services. This suggests that more targeted interventions are required.},
