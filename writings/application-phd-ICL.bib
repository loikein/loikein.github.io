A day with temperature above 30°C was associated with 3·5 more admissions per hospital (SE 0·45), relative to a 10–15°C day. This increased to 14·1 excess admissions per hospital (SE 5·56) over the following 30 days, generating 786 excess admissions across England per heatwave day. A day under –5°C generated 3·8 more admissions per hospital (SE 0·33), or 966 excess admissions across England. This increased to 62·3 admissions per hospital (SE 4·83) over the following 30 days. These effects were heterogeneous across age and deprivation level. Populations older than 74 years were up to 8 times more affected by extreme temperatures. Individuals living in low-employment and low-income areas were 2–10 times more likely to be admitted during a temperature shock.

Population health is negatively affected by hot and cold temperature shocks, with older people and those living in low-employment and low-income areas disproportionately affected. Findings were unadjusted for pollution and possible individual protective behaviours, providing underestimated—yet policy-applicable—risks of temperature. A heterogeneous lag effect indicates the importance of considering vulnerable populations in policy making to ensure mitigation and resilience policies are not restricted to immediate temperature shocks only and are sensitive to vulnerable populations, mitigating inequalities in access to health care.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}British Academy and Imperial College Business School.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In 2006, the Massachusetts healthcare reform was introduced to mandate health insurance, extend eligibility of publicly subsidised health insurance, improve quality and access to care and develop preventive health services. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of expanding publicly subsidised health insurance through the Massachusetts reform on access to primary care, disease management and behavioural risk factors. Using cross-sectional data from the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 2001 to 2010 and exploiting the selective introduction of the healthcare reform, we assessed its impact on primary care access, behavioural risk factors, such as obesity, and receipt of diabetes management tests. We did so using a differences-in-differences methodology by comparing Massachusetts with other New England States for 131,002 adults under 300\% of the federal poverty level and by race/ethnicity within this group. Triple difference estimates were also conducted to control for potential within state time varying confounding factors. The results suggest that increasing publicly subsidised health insurance had a positive impact on primary care access for lower income adults, particularly those that are white. However, with the exception of improvements in alcohol consumption for one specific group (lower income whites) the reform had no effect on behaviour risk factors or diabetes disease management. The aims of the reform were to improve access to care and through this, behavioural risk factors and diabetes management. This study suggests that while access to care was increased, reducing risk factors attributed to health risky behaviour and diabetes cannot be sufficiently done simply by extending health insurance coverage and the provision of preventive services. This suggests that more targeted interventions are required.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32862-4},
	abstract = {Background
Nudge-based social norm messages conveying high influenza vaccination coverage levels signal a strong social norm, encouraging vaccination, but also a low risk of infection, discouraging vaccination and promoting free-riding. The complex interplay between these two signals can result in ambiguous vaccination decision-making at varying coverage levels. We aimed to measure different vaccination coverage levels’ (VCLs) effect on influenza vaccination intention through an online experiment.
Methods
UK residents aged 18 years or older were eligible to participate in this online experiment and recruited via Prolific. They were stratified by gender and randomly assigned to a control group with no message (n=202) or one of seven treatment groups (n=1 163) with different messages of VCLs (ie, proportion of vaccinated people [10\%, 25\%, 50\%, 65\%, 75\%, 85\%, or 95\%]) in the respondents’ environment. Effect on respondents’ vaccination intention was measured with self-reported intention and three elicited behaviour measures: opening an online map locating nearby private flu jab providers; time looking at this map; and downloading a calendar reminder to vaccinate. Linear regressions, probit, logistic, and double hurdle models were used, controlling for population behaviour perceptions, risk attitudes, and behavioural and socioeconomic characteristics collected through individual questionnaires.
Findings
Between May 3 and August 20, 2018, 1365 participants were eligible to participate. Those treated with coverage levels at 65\% or higher reported significantly greater stated vaccination intention (greater intention 13·2\% [95\% CI 6·32–20·08], p{\textless}0·0001 if VCL=65\%; 15·82\% [8·65–23], p{\textless}0·0001 if VCL=75\%; 18·12\% [10·45–25·79], p {\textless}0·0001 if VCL=85\%; 20·22\% [11·98–28·45], p{\textless}0·0001 if VCL=95\%) than the control group. These participants were also more likely to look at the map of vaccination locations (increased likelihood 14·6 percentage points [3·65–25·55], p=0·0090; 20·81 percentage points [9·73–31·88], p{\textless}0·0001; 18·4 percentage points [6·57–30·23], p=0·0023; 14·12 percentage points [1·27–26·96], p=0·031), and spent longer looking at the map (longer viewing 0·52 s [0·13–0·91], p=0·0094; 0·74 s [0·34–1·14], p{\textless}0·0001; 0·65 s [0·23–1·08], p=0·0025; 0·5 s [0·04–0·96], p=0·032) than the control group. Coverage lower than 65\% did not lead to any significant differences between treatment and control groups for any of these measures. There was no significant effect of any treatment VCL on calendar download intention.
Interpretation
Average vaccination intention was higher at lower coverage levels (potential social norm compliance) but lower at higher coverage levels (possible free-riding). Because this study examines vaccination intention rather than uptake and uses an online experimental design that might dampen generalisability, further research should be done. Still, policy makers should consider this curvilinear effect when designing vaccination interventions as using lower social norm messages might nudge vaccination better than extremely high messages.

	abstract = {Background
Voluntary licences are increasingly being used to expand access to patented essential medicines in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Since 2014, non-exclusive voluntary licences have been issued by Gilead and Bristol-Myers Squibb for key drugs for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We aimed to evaluate the effect of these licences on access to HCV treatment.
Methods
We conducted a difference-in-differences analysis, exploiting the staggered and selective introduction of voluntary licensing in different countries, to identify the effect of voluntary licensing agreements on treatment uptake. We extracted Polaris Observatory data on the total number of people infected with HCV, diagnosed with HCV, and treated for HCV, and constructed a longitudinal panel of LMICs over a 13-year period (2004–16). Countries were included if they were classified as LMICs by the World Bank in 2014, and had available data on HCV outcomes. The exposure was defined as inclusion in any voluntary licence agreement for HCV drugs. Treatment uptake was calculated as the number of people treated for HCV in a given year per 1000 living people ever diagnosed with HCV. We fit difference-in-differences linear regression models controlling for different confounders that could influence treatment access and uptake, including country and year fixed effects and a range of country-level factors. We additionally assessed the dynamics of the effect and the robustness of our findings.
Findings
35 countries were included in the panel: 19 in the intervention group and 16 in the control group. In the simplest model, adjusting only for country and year fixed effects, voluntary licences were associated with an increase in the annual number of people accessing HCV treatment of 69·3 per 1000 diagnosed (95\% CI 46·7–91·9; p=0·0060). After adjusting for country-level covariates, this increase was 53·6 per 1000 diagnosed (25·8–81·5; p=0·0354). The effect of licensing increased over time, and was largest in the second year after implementation. Results were robust to alternative specifications.
Interpretation
Voluntary licensing initiatives appear to substantially improve HCV treatment uptake in eligible countries. This evidence supports the expansion of licensing strategies to include more countries and more treatments.

The private sector has long been using marketing to influence and change people’s lifestyles. In some cases, particularly the food sector, health-compromising content is prioritized over health-promoting content. However, this case study aims to illustrate how governments working on tight budgets can partner with private media companies to their own advantage in order to increase the impact of health messages and thus improve the health literacy of the population. The omnichannel communication platform and associated campaigns initiated by the Portuguese government and described in this case study serve as a practical example of a national health literacy initiative successfully reaching a wide audience. Indeed, the Portuguese National Health Service entered high on the list of the most impactful communication campaigns in Portugal.This might have implications for other countries as although further progress is required to analyse any impact of the campaigns, this example showcases the potential advantages of partnering with the media in that by using the same communication channels as multinational food and tobacco companies, governments may be able to level the playing field in terms of influence through marketing and communication, which might help to reverse unhealthy lifestyles among their populations.},

Methods: The 2015 co-regulation agreement sets voluntary targets for reducing sugar, salt and trans-fatty acids in a range of products by 2021. We obtained government data on dietary intake in 2015-2016 and on population structure and deaths from four major noncommunicable diseases over 1990-2016. We used the Preventable Risk Integrated ModEl tool to estimate the deaths averted if reformulation targets were met in full. We projected future trends in noncommunicable disease deaths using regression modelling and assessed whether Portugal was on track to reduce baseline premature deaths from noncommunicable diseases in the year 2010 by 25\% by 2025, and by 30\% before 2030. Findings: If reformulation targets were met, we projected reductions in intake in 2015-2016 for salt from 7.6 g/day to 7.1 g/day; in total energy from 1911 kcal/day to 1897 kcal/day due to reduced sugar intake; and in total fat (\% total energy) from 30.4\% to 30.3\% due to reduced trans-fat intake. This consumption profile would result in 248 fewer premature noncommunicable disease deaths (95\% CI: 178 to 318) in 2016. We projected that full implementation of the industry agreement would reduce the risk of premature death from 11.0\% in 2016 to 10.7\% by 2021. Conclusion: The co-regulation agreement could save lives and reduce the risk of premature death in Portugal. Nevertheless, the projected impact on mortality was insufficient to meet international targets.},

	abstract = {Objective In this paper we model the reduction in premature mortality associated with Noncommunicacle Diseases as a result of the establishment of a co-regulation agreement between the Portuguese Ministry of Health and the Portuguese food industry. We also assess whether Portugal is on track to meet the international targets of reducing baseline 2010 premature deaths from noncommunicable diseases by 25\% by 2025, and by 30\% before 2030. We also aimed to model the impact of the industry co-regulation agreement on premature mortality. Methods The 2015co-regulation agreement agreement between the Portuguese food industry and the Portuguese government sets targets of reducing sugar by 20\%, salt content by 16\% (30\% for bread), and {\textless}2g trans fatty acids per 100g of fat in a range of products by 2021. The WHO Europe-endorsed PRIME modelling tool was used to estimate the number of Noncommunicacle Diseases deaths that would be averted if these reformulation targets were fully met in the year 2016. Using data on population structure, Noncommunicacle Diseases mortality, and dietary intake from the Portuguese Directorate General of Health, we calculated the actual trends on premature mortality probability for Noncommunicacle Diseases, and projected future trends using regression modelling. Findings The risk of premature Noncommunicacle Diseases mortality fell from 13.9\% to 10.9\% between 2000-2010 but remained relatively unchanged up until 2016. We project that the risk will rise to 11.0\% by 2030. If the industry reformulation targets are met we estimate reductions in salt intake of around 7\%; total energy reductions from 1,911Kcal/day to 1,897 kcal/day due to reduced sugar intake; and reductions in total fat (\% total energy) from 30.4\% to 30.3\% due to reduced trans fat intake. The PRIME modelling tool calculates that this consumption profile would have resulted in 873 fewer Noncommunicacle Diseases deaths (95\%CI 483–1,107) and 247 fewer premature Noncommunicacle Diseases deaths (95\%CI 175-317) from cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, cancers, and diabetes in 2016. Based on this reduction, we project that full implementation of the industry agreement would reduce the risk of premature death from 11\% to 10.7\% by 2021. Conclusions The co-regulation agreement stands to save lives and reduce risk of premature death in Portugal. Nevertheless, even if its targets are met in full, the overall impact on mortality will be modest and insufficient to meet international targets.},

	abstract = {Influenza pandemics considerably burden affected health systems due to surges in inpatient admissions and associated costs. Previous studies underestimate or overestimate 2009/2010 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic hospital admissions and costs. We robustly estimate overall and age-specific weekly H1N1 admissions and costs between June 2009 and March 2011 across 170 English hospitals. We calculate H1N1 admissions and costs as the difference between our administrative data of all influenza-like-illness patients (seasonal and pandemic alike) and a counterfactual of expected weekly seasonal influenza admissions and costs established using time-series models on prepandemic (2004–2008) data. We find two waves of H1N1 admissions: one pandemic wave (June 2009–March 2010) with 10,348 admissions costing £20.5 million and one postpandemic wave (November 2010–March 2011) with 11,775 admissions costing £24.8 million. Patients aged 0–4 years old have the highest H1N1 admission rate, and 25- to 44- and 65+-year-olds have the highest costs. Our estimates are up to 4.3 times higher than previous reports, suggesting that the pandemic's burden on hospitals was formerly underassessed. Our findings can help hospitals manage unexpected surges in admissions and resource use due to pandemics.},

	abstract = {Major medical innovations have greatly increased the efficacy of treatments, improved patient outcomes, and often reduced the cost of medical care. However, innovations do not diffuse uniformly across and within health systems. Due to the high complexity of medical treatment decisions, variations in clinical practice are inherent to healthcare delivery, regardless of technological advances, new ways of working, funding, and burden of disease. In this article we conduct a narrative literature review to identify and discuss peer-reviewed articles presenting a theoretical framework or empirical evidence of the factors associated with the adoption of innovation and clinical practice.We find that variation in innovation adoption and medical practice is associated with multiple factors. First, patients’ characteristics, including medical needs and genetic factors, can crucially affect clinical outcomes and the efficacy of treatments. Moreover, differences in patients’ preferences can be an important source of variation. Medical treatments may need to take such patient characteristics into account if they are to deliver optimal outcomes, and consequently, resulting practice variations should be considered warranted and in the best interests of patients. However, socioeconomic or demographic characteristics, such as ethnicity, income, or gender are often not considered legitimate grounds for differential treatment. Second, physician characteristics—such as socioeconomic profile, training, and work-related characteristics—are equally an influential component of practice variation. In particular, so-called “practice style” and physicians’ attitudes toward risk and innovation adoption are considered a major source of practice variation, but have proven difficult to investigate empirically. Lastly, features of healthcare systems—notably, public coverage of healthcare expenditure, cost-based reimbursement of providers, and service-delivery organization, are generally associated with higher utilization rates and adoption of innovation.Research shows some successful strategies aimed at reducing variation in medical decision-making, such as the use of decision aids, data feedback, benchmarking, clinical practice guidelines, blinded report cards, and pay for performance. But despite these advances, there is uneven diffusion of new technologies and procedures, with potentially severe adverse efficiency and equity implications.},

	abstract = {Waiting time for non-emergency medical care in developing countries is rarely of immediate concern to policy makers that prioritize provision of basic health services. However, waiting time as a measure of health system responsiveness is important because longer waiting times worsen health outcomes and affect utilization of services. Studies that assess socio-economic inequalities in waiting time provide evidence from developed countries such as England and the United States; evidence from developing countries is lacking. In this paper, we assess the relationship between social class i.e. caste of an individual and waiting time at health facilities—a client orientation dimension of responsiveness. We use household level data from two rounds of the Indian Human Development Survey with a sample size of 27,251 households in each wave (2005 and 2012) and find that lower social class is associated with higher waiting time. This relationship is significant for individuals that visited a male provider but not so for those that visited a female provider. Further, caste is positively related to higher waiting time only if visiting a private facility; for individuals visiting a government facility the relationship between waiting time and caste is not significant. In general, caste related inequality in waiting time has worsened over time. The results are robust to different specifications and the inclusion of several confounders.},

	abstract = {Background International and domestic funding for malaria is critically important to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Its equitable distribution is key in ensuring that the available, scarce, resources are deployed efficiently for improved progress and a sustained response that enables eradication.
Methods We used concentration curves and concentration indices to assess inequalities in malaria funding by different donors across countries, measuring both horizontal and vertical equity. Horizontal equity assesses whether funding is distributed in proportion to health needs, whereas vertical equity examines whether unequal economic needs are addressed by appropriately unequal funding. We computed the Health Inequity Index and the Kakwani Index to assess the former and the latter, respectively. We used data from the World Bank, Global Fund, Unicef, President’s Malaria Initiative and the Malaria Atlas Project to assess the distribution of funding against need for 94 countries. National gross domestic product per capita was used as a proxy for economic need and ‘population-at-risk’ for health need.
Findings The level and direction of inequity varies across funding sources. Unicef and the President’s Malaria Initiative were the most horizontally inequitable (pro-poor). Inequity as shown by the Health Inequity Index for Unicef decreased from −0.40 (P{\textless}0.05) in 2006 to −0.25 (P{\textless}0.10) in 2008, and increased again to −0.58 (P{\textless}0.01) in 2009. For President’s Malaria Initiative, it increased from −0.19 (P{\textgreater}0.10) in 2006 to −0.38 (P{\textless}0.05) in 2008, and decreased to −0.36 (P{\textless}0.10) in 2010. Domestic funding was inequitable (pro-rich) with inequity increasing from 0.28 (P{\textless}0.01) in 2006 to 0.39 (P{\textless}0.01) in 2009, and then decreasing to 0.22 (P{\textless}0.10) in 2010. Funding from the World Bank and the Global Fund was distributed proportionally according to need. In terms of vertical inequity, all sources were progressive: Unicef and the President’s Malaria Initiative were the most progressive with the Kakwani Indices ranging from −0.97 (P{\textless}0.01) to −1.29 (P{\textless}0.01), and −0.90 (P{\textless}0.01) to −1.10 (P{\textless}0.01), respectively.
Conclusion Our results suggest that external funding of malaria treatment tends to be allocated to countries with higher health and economic need but not in proportion to their relative health need and income when compared to other countries. While malaria eradication might require funders to disproportionally allocate funding that goes beyond (financial and health) need, our analysis highlights that funders might potentially be targeting in excess certain countries. Regular assessments of need and greater coordination among donors are necessary for equitable resource allocation, to improve and sustain progress with malaria control and elimination.},

Across Greater London, 24\% of play spaces, 67\% of private parks and 27\% of public parks had average levels of NO2 that exceeded the EU limit for NO2. Rates of exceedance were higher in Inner London; open spaces in the City of London had the highest average NO2 values among all the London Boroughs.

	abstract = {Background Air pollution damages health by promoting the onset of some non-communicable diseases (NCDs), putting additional strain on the National Health Service (NHS) and social care. This study quantifies the total health and related NHS and social care cost burden due to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in England. Method and findings Air pollutant concentration surfaces from land use regression models and cost data from hospital admissions data and a literature review were fed into a microsimulation model, that was run from 2015 to 2035. Different scenarios were modelled: (1) baseline ‘no change’ scenario; (2) individuals’ pollutant exposure is reduced to natural (non-anthropogenic) levels to compute the disease cases attributable to PM2.5 and NO2; (3) PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations reduced by 1 μg/m3; and (4) NO2 annual European Union limit values reached (40 μg/m3). For the 18 years after baseline, the total cumulative cost to the NHS and social care is estimated at £5.37 billion for PM2.5 and NO2 combined, rising to £18.57 billion when costs for diseases for which there is less robust evidence are included. These costs are due to the cumulative incidence of air-pollution-related NCDs, such as 348,878 coronary heart disease cases estimated to be attributable to PM2.5 and 573,363 diabetes cases estimated to be attributable to NO2 by 2035. Findings from modelling studies are limited by the conceptual model, assumptions, and the availability and quality of input data. Conclusions Approximately 2.5 million cases of NCDs attributable to air pollution are predicted by 2035 if PM2.5 and NO2 stay at current levels, making air pollution an important public health priority. In future work, the modelling framework should be updated to include multi-pollutant exposure–response functions, as well as to disaggregate results by socioeconomic status.},

Ironically, it is the healthcare sector itself that is primarily affected by any deterioration in the environment affecting individuals’ health and their demand for healthcare. Therefore, the healthcare sector is a direct beneficiary of its own steps towards sustainability and is more and more viewed as the one who should lead the change. In this article, we first review the concepts of financial and environmental sustainability. Second, we discuss the existing evidence of sustainable changes within this sector. Third, we propose a simple adaptation of the classic cost-effectiveness analysis to incorporate carbon footprinting to account for these external costs. We illustrate our method using the case of in-centre versus home haemodialysis. We conclude that home dialysis is always a preferable alternative to in-centre treatment based on a cost-effectiveness analysis. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our approach and the future research agenda.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
