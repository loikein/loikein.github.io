Warning: Finance is not among my favourite subjects

## General Principles

- Competitive Market: good can be bought and sold at the same price (__Competitive Market Price__) 
- Valuation Principle: value of an asset to the firm or its investors is determined by its competitive market price 

### Net Present Value (NPV)

- Risk-Free Interest Rate: $r_f$ 
- Interest Rate Factor: $(1+r_f)$ 
- Discount Factor: $\frac{1}{1+r}$ 
- Present Value (PV) and Future Value (FV): $PV \times (1+r_f) = FV$ 
- Net Present Value (NPV): $$\begin{aligned} NPV &= PV(\text{benefits}) - PV(\text{costs}) \\ &= PV(\text{all cash flows})\end{aligned}$$ 

### Interest Rates

- Effective Annual Rate (EAR): the actual amount of interest that will be earned at the end of one year 
    - or: Effective Annual Yield (EAY), Annual Percentage Yield (APY)
- Annual Percentage Rate (APR): the amount of interest earned without compounding, $APR < EAR$ 
- Given APR, if interest is compounded $k$ times a year, actual interest: $$1+EAR = \left(1+\frac{APR}{k}\right)^k$$ 

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

- Given PV and cash flows, the interest rate s.t. $$NPV = -\text{investment} + PV(\text{return}) = 0$$ 

### Tax

- After Tax Interest Rate: $r\cdot (1-τ)$

### (Opportunity) Cost of Capital

- The best available expected return offered in the market on an investment

### Time Travel for Money

- Compounding: when moving a value forward in time, multiply by $(1 + r)$
    - Compound Interest: earning interest on interest
    - Future Value of cash flow $C$ in $n$ years: $FV_n = C\cdot (1 + r)^n$ 
- Discounting: when moving a value back in time, divide by $(1 + r)$
    - Present Value of cash flow $C$ in $n$ years: $PV_n = \frac{C}{(1 + r)^n}$ 

### Arbitrage

- Arbitrage Opportunity: when it is possible to make a profit without taking any risk or making any investment 
    - $NPV>0$ 
- Normal Market: competitive market where no arbitrage opportunities exist

### Law of One Price 

- Equivalent investment opportunities
- Trade simultaneously
- In different competitive (normal) markets

### Efficient Markets Hypothesis

textbook P300, P459

- NPV of investing is zero
- Securities with equivalent risks have same expected return
- Highly idealized

## Cash Flow Stream

- PV of Cash Flow Stream: $$\begin{aligned} PV &= C_0 + \frac{C_1}{1 + r} + \frac{C_2}{(1 + r)^2} +\cdots + \frac{C_N}{(1 + r)^N}\\ &= \sum_{n=0}^N \frac{C_n}{(1 + r)^n}\end{aligned}$$ 
- FV of Cash Flow Stream: $FV = PV\cdot (1+r)^n$

### Perpetuity

- Perpetuity: a bond that pays a stream of regular equal cash flows forever (e.g. consol)
- PV of Perpetuity: $$\begin{aligned} PV &= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{C}{(1 + r)^n} \\ &= \frac{C}{r}\end{aligned}$$ 
- By depositing the amount $\frac{C}{r}$ today, we can withdraw interest of $\frac{C}{r}\cdot r=C$ each period 
- PV of Growing Perpetuity with growth rate $g$: $PV = \frac{C}{r-g}$

### Annuity

- Annuity: a bond that pays a stream of regular equal cash flows for $N$ periods 
- PV of Annuity: $$\begin{aligned} PV &= \sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{C}{(1 + r)^n} \\ &= \frac{C}{r}\left( 1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^N}\right)\end{aligned}$$ 
- FV of Annuity: $$\begin{aligned} FV &= PV\cdot (1+r)^N \\ &= \frac{C}{r}\left( 1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^N}\right)\cdot (1+r)^N \\ &= \frac{C}{r}\cdot \left[(1+r)^N - 1\right]\end{aligned}$$ 
- PV of Growing Annuity with growth rate $g$: $PV = \frac{C}{r-g}\left( 1-\Big(\frac{1+g}{1+r}\Big)^N\right)$

> Mock.I.Q1  
> Jane is 35 years old and she has decided it is time to plan seriously for her retirement.  
> At the end of each year until she is 65, she will save $10,000 in a retirement account.  
> If the account earns 10% per year, how much will Jane have saved at age 65?

$$\begin{aligned} FV &= \frac{C}{r}\cdot \left[(1+r)^N - 1\right] \\
&= \frac{10000}{10\%}\cdot \left[(1+10\%)^{30} - 1\right] \\
&= 1644940\end{aligned}$$ 

> PS.6-5.1  
> Bill Clinton reportedly was paid $10 million to write his book My Way. The book took three years to write.  
> In the time he spent writing, Clinton could have been paid to make speeches.  
> Given his popularity, assume that he could earn $8 million per year (paid at the end of the year) speaking instead of writing.  
> Assume his cost of capital is 10% per year.  
> What is the NPV of agreeing to write the book (ignoring any royalty payments)?  

NPV of the book: 
$$\begin{aligned} NPV &= PV(\text{income}) - PV(\text{cost}) \\
&= 10 - \frac{8}{10\%}\left(1-\frac{1}{(1+10\%)^3}\right) \\
&= -9.895 \end{aligned}$$ 

> PS.6-5.2  
> Bill Clinton reportedly was paid $10 million to write his book My Way. The book took three years to write.  
> In the time he spent writing, Clinton could have been paid to make speeches.  
> Given his popularity, assume that he could earn $8 million per year (paid at the end of the year) speaking instead of writing.  
> Assume his cost of capital is 10% per year.  
> Assume that, once the book is finished, it is expected to generate royalties of $5 million in the first year (paid at the end of the year) and these royalties are expected to decrease at a rate of 30% per year in perpetuity.  
> What is the NPV of the book with the royalty payments?

PV of royalty at $t=3$:  
$$\begin{aligned} PV &= \frac{C}{r-g} \\ &= \frac{5}{10\% - (- 30\%)} \\ &= 12.5\end{aligned}$$ 
PV of royalty at today:  
$$\frac{12.5}{(1+10\%)^3} = 9.391$$ 
NPV of the book with royalty:  
$$\begin{aligned} NPV &= -9.895 + 9.391 \\
&= -0.504 \end{aligned}$$ 

## Decision Rules

### NPV Rule

- Accept the project with the highest NPV
- As long as $NPV>0$, the project increases the value of the firm 

### IRR Rule

- Take any investment opportunity where $IRR \geq r_f$
- Turn down any opportunity where $IRR < r_f$
    - When projects differ in scale of investment, timing of cash flows, or riskiness, then the IRR cannot be meaningfully compared

### Payback Rule

- Accept a project only if its cash flows pay back its initial investment within a prespecified period 

## Bond

- Price: $P$
- Maturity Date: date of final repayment
- Term: time remaining before the next repayment
- Face Value (Principle): the amount repaid at maturity in addition to coupon (if not zero)
- Coupon: the amount paid at each term
- Coupon Rate: ratio of each coupon repayment (APR)
- Coupon Payment (CPN): $$CPN = \frac{\text{Coupon Rate}\times\text{Face Value}}{\text{# of repayments per year}}$$ 
- Yield (to Maturity) (YTM or $y$): s.t. Price $P = PV(\text{Face Value})$ 

<!-- $$YTM = \frac{APR}{\text{# of repayments per year}}$$  -->

### Bond Price

|                      | Amount   | Ratio                    |
| ----------------     | -------- | ------------------------ |
| above par (premium)  | $P > FV$ | $\text{Coupon Rate}>YTM$ |
| at par               | $P=FV$   | $\text{Coupon Rate}=YTM$ |
| below par (discount) | $P<FV$   | $\text{Coupon Rate}<YTM$ |

### Zero-Coupon Bond

- Pay no coupon, only face value
    - or: Pure Discount Bond (e.g. Treasury bill)
- YTM: 
$$\begin{aligned} P &= \frac{\text{Face Value}}{(1+YTM_n)^n} \\
YTM_n &= \left(\frac{\text{Face Value}}{P}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}-1 \end{aligned}$$ 
- $YTM_n = r_f$

> textbook P72  
> Consider a simple security that promises a one-time payment to its owner of $1000 in one year’s time.  
> Suppose there is no risk that the payment will not be made.  
> If the risk-free interest rate is 5%, what can we conclude about the price of this bond in a normal market?

$$\begin{aligned} PV(1000\text{ in one year}) &= \frac{1000}{1+5\%} \\
&= 952.38\text{ today} \\ &= \text{No Arbitrage Price of Bond}\end{aligned}$$ 
Suppose the bond traded for a price of $940, we can buy the bond for $940 and at the same time borrow $952.38 from the bank.  
Given the 5% interest rate, we will owe the bank $952.38 \times 1.05 = 1000$ in one year.  
We can earn $12.38 in cash today for each bond that we buy, without taking any risk or paying any of our own money in the future.

Suppose the bond is trading for $960, we should __(short) sell__ the bond, and invest $952.38 at the bank.  
We then earn $7.62 in cash today, yet keep our future cash flows unchanged by replacing the $1000 we would have received from the bond with the $1000 we will receive from the bank.

### Coupon Bond

- YTM: 
$$\begin{aligned} P &= \frac{CPN}{1+YTM} + \frac{CPN}{(1+YTM)^2} + \cdots + \frac{CPN+\text{Face Value}}{(1+YTM)^N}\\
&= \frac{CPN}{1+YTM} + \frac{CPN}{(1+YTM)^2} + \cdots + \frac{CPN}{(1+YTM)^N} + \frac{\text{Face Value}}{(1+YTM)^N}\\
&= \frac{CPN}{YTM}\left(1-\frac{1}{(1+YTM)^N}\right) + \frac{\text{Face Value}}{(1+YTM)^N}\end{aligned}$$

    - e.g. Treasury notes, Treasury bonds

> PS.8-11  
> Suppose that General Motors Acceptance Corporation issued a bond with 10 years until maturity, a face value of $1000, and a coupon rate of 7% (annual payments).  
> The yield to maturity on this bond when it was issued was 6%.  
> 1. What was the price of this bond when it was issued?  
> 2. Assuming the yield to maturity remains constant, what is the price of the bond immediately before it makes its first coupon payment?  
> 3. Assuming the yield to maturity remains constant, what is the price of the bond immediately after it makes its first coupon payment?  

1. Coupon Payment:  
$$\begin{aligned} CPN &= \frac{\text{Coupon Rate}\times\text{Face Value}}{\text{# of repayments per year}} \\
&= \frac{7\%\times 1000}{1} \\ &= 70\end{aligned}$$ 
Price of bond:  
$$\begin{aligned} P &= \frac{CPN}{1+YTM} + \frac{CPN}{(1+YTM)^2} + \cdots + \frac{CPN + \text{Face Value}}{(1+YTM)^N}\\
&= \frac{70}{6\%}\left(1-\frac{1}{(1+6\%)^{10}}\right) + \frac{1000}{(1+6\%)^{10}} \\
&= 1073.60\end{aligned}$$ 
2. Price before the first coupon payment:  
$$\begin{aligned} P &= CPN + \frac{CPN}{1+YTM} + \cdots + \frac{CPN + \text{Face Value}}{(1+YTM)^9} \\
&= 70 + \frac{70}{1+6\%} + \cdots + \frac{70 + 1000}{(1+6\%)^9} \\
&= 1138.02\end{aligned}$$ 
3. Price after the first coupon payment:  
$$\begin{aligned} P &= \frac{CPN}{1+YTM} + \cdots + \frac{CPN + \text{Face Value}}{(1+YTM)^9} \\
&= \frac{70}{1+6\%} + \cdots + \frac{70 + 1000}{(1+6\%)^9} \\
&= 1068.02\end{aligned}$$ 

> PS.8-24  
> Assume there are four default-free bonds with the following prices and future cash flows:
>
> |    |             | Future -|- Cash -|- Flows|
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Bond | Price Today | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
| A    | 934.58      | 1,000  | 0      | 0      |
| B    | 881.66      | 0      | 1,000  | 0      |
| C    | 1,118.21    | 100    | 100    | 1,100  |
| D    | 839.62      | 0      | 0      | 1,000  |
>
> Do these bonds present an arbitrage opportunity?  
> If so, how would you take advantage of this opportunity? If not, why not?

Bond A:  
$$\begin{aligned} 934.58 &= \frac{1000}{1+YTM_1} \\
YTM_1 = 7.0\%\end{aligned}$$ 
Bond B:  
$$\begin{aligned} 881.66 &= \frac{1000}{(1+YTM_2)^2} \\
YTM_2 = 6.5\%\end{aligned}$$ 
Bond D:  
$$\begin{aligned} 839.62 &= \frac{1000}{(1+YTM_3)^3} \\
YTM_3 = 6.0\%\end{aligned}$$ 
If YTM's are consistent, price for bond C should be:  
$$\begin{aligned} P &= \frac{CPN}{1+YTM_1} + \frac{CPN}{(1+YTM_2)^2} + \frac{CPN}{(1+YTM_3)^3} \\
&= \frac{100}{1+7.0\%} + \frac{100}{(1+6.5\%)^2} + \frac{1100}{(1+6.0\%)^3} \\
&= 1105.2 < 1,118.21\end{aligned}$$ 
Therefore, there is an arbitrage opportunity.  
Since bond C is overpriced, one can short sell bond C and buy bond A, B, D at the same time. 

## Stock

### Dividend-Discount Model

- Stock’s total return = expected return of other investments with equivalent risk 
- Dividend by the end of the $n$-th year: $Div_n$ 
- Stock Price in one year: $$P_0 = \frac{Div_1 + P_1}{1+r_E}$$ 
- Equity Cost of Capital = Total Return (Rate): $$\begin{aligned} r_E &= \frac{Div_1 + P_1}{P_0} - 1 \\ &= \underbrace{\frac{Div_1}{P_0}}_{\text{Dividend Yield}}+\underbrace{\frac{P_1-P_0}{P_0}}_{\text{Capital Gain Rate}}\end{aligned}$$ 
- Stock Price in two years: 
$$\begin{aligned} P_0 &= \frac{Div_1 + P_1}{1+r_E} \\
&= \frac{Div_1}{1+r_E} + \frac{1}{1+r_E}\cdot\underbrace{\frac{Div_2+P_2}{1+r_E}}_{P_1} \\
&= \frac{Div_1}{1+r_E} + \frac{Div_2+P_2}{(1+r_E)^2}\end{aligned}$$ 
- Stock Price in $N$ years: 
$$\begin{aligned} P_0 &= \frac{Div_1}{1+r_E} + \frac{Div_2}{(1+r_E)^2} +\cdots + \frac{Div_N}{(1+r_E)^N}+ \frac{P_N}{(1+r_E)^N} \\
(N\to\infty) \ &= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{Div_n}{(1+r_E)^n}\end{aligned}$$ 
- Constant Dividend Growth: 
$$\begin{aligned} P_0 &=\frac{Div_1}{r_E-g} \\
r_E &= \frac{Div_1}{P_0} - g\end{aligned}$$ 
- Stock Price in $N$ years with Constant Dividend Growth: 
$$P_0 = \frac{Div_1}{1+r_E} + \frac{Div_2}{(1+r_E)^2} +\cdots + \frac{Div_N}{(1+r_E)^N}+ \frac{1}{(1+r_E)^N}\cdot\underbrace{\frac{Div_{N+1}}{r_E-g}}_{P_N}$$ 
- Dividend Payout Rate: 
$$Div_t = \frac{\text{earnings}}{\text{# of shares}}\times\text{Dividend Payout Rate}_t$$ 
- Earnings and Growth Rate: 
$$\begin{aligned} \text{change in earnings} &= \text{new investment}\times\text{return} \\
&= \text{earnings}\times\text{retention rate}\times\text{return} \\
g &= \frac{\text{change in earnings}}{\text{earnings}} \\
&= \text{retention rate}\times\text{return}\end{aligned}$$ 

> PS.9-2  
> Anle Corporation has a current price of $20, is expected to pay a dividend of $1 in one year, and its expected price right after paying that dividend is $22.  
> 1. What is Anle’s expected dividend yield?  
> 2. What is Anle’s expected capital gain rate?  
> 3. What is Anle’s equity cost of capital?  

1. Expected dividend yield: 
$$\begin{aligned} \frac{Div_1}{P_0} &= \frac{1}{20} \\ &= 5\%\end{aligned}$$ 
2. Expected capital gain rate: 
$$\begin{aligned} \frac{P_1-P_0}{P_0} &= \frac{22-20}{20} \\ &= 10\%\end{aligned}$$ 
3. Equity cost of capital: 
$$\begin{aligned} P_0 &= \frac{Div_1 + P_1}{1+r_E} \\
20 &= \frac{1 + 22}{1+r_E} \\
r_E &= 15\%\end{aligned}$$ 

> PS.9-9  
> DFB, Inc., expects earnings this year of $5 per share, and it plans to pay a $3 dividend to shareholders.  
> DFB will retain $2 per share of its earnings to reinvest in new projects with an expected return of 15% per year.  
> Suppose DFB will maintain the same dividend payout rate, retention rate, and return on new investments in the future and will not change its number of outstanding shares.  
> 1. What growth rate of earnings would you forecast for DFB?  
> 2. If DFB’s equity cost of capital is 12%, what price would you estimate for DFB stock?  
> 3. Suppose DFB instead paid a dividend of $4 per share this year and retained only $1 per share in earnings.  
> If DFB maintains this higher payout rate in the future, what stock price would you estimate now?  
> Should DFB raise its dividend?

1. Expected growth rate of earnings: 
$$\begin{aligned} g &= \text{retention rate}\times\text{return} \\
&= \frac{2}{5}\cdot 15\% \\
&= 6\%\end{aligned}$$ 
2. Expected price of stock: 
$$\begin{aligned} P_0 &=\frac{Div_1}{r_E-g} \\
&= \frac{3}{12\% - 6\%} \\ &= 50\end{aligned}$$ 
3. Expected growth rate of earnings: 
$$\begin{aligned} g &= \text{retention rate}\times\text{return} \\
&= \frac{1}{5}\cdot 15\% \\
&= 3\%\end{aligned}$$ 
Expected price of stock: 
$$\begin{aligned} P_0 &=\frac{Div_1}{r_E-g} \\
&= \frac{4}{12\% - 3\%} \\ &= 44\end{aligned}$$ 
Since expected return of new project is $15\% > 12\%$ (equity cost of capital), DFB should not raise its dividend. 

### Total Payout Model

- Share price: $P_0 = \frac{FV(\text{future dividends and repurchase})}{\text{# of shares}}$

### Discounted FCF (Free Cash Flow) Model

- Value of Firm: 
$$\text{firm value} = \text{market value of equity} + \text{debt} - \text{cash}$$ 
- Free Cash Flow: 
$$FCF = \underbrace{\text{pre-tax earnings}}_{\text{EBIT}}\cdot (1-τ) - \text{net investment} - (\underbrace{\text{assets} - \text{liability}}_{\text{net working capital}})$$ 
- Current Value of Firm: $$V_0 = PV(\text{future FCF})$$ 
- Future (Terminal) Value of Firm: $$\begin{aligned} V_N &= \frac{FCF_{N+1}}{r_{WACC} - g_{FCF}} \\ &= \frac{FCF_N\cdot (1+g_{FCF})}{r_{WACC} - g_{FCF}} \end{aligned}$$ 
- Stock Price: $$P_0 = \frac{V_0 + \text{cash}_0 - \text{debt}_0}{\text{# of shares}}$$ 
- with WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital): 
$$V_0 = \frac{FCF_1}{1+r_{WACC}} + \frac{FCF_2}{(1+r_{WACC})^2} +\cdots + \frac{FCF_N}{(1+r_{WACC})^N}+ \frac{V_N}{(1+r_{WACC})^N}$$

> Estimate the value of IDX per share using a discounted FCF approach and the following data:  
> - Debt: $30 million

> - Future FCF growth rate beyond 2010: 5%  
> - Weighted-average cost of capital: 9.4%

Expected value of firm in 2009:  
$$\begin{aligned} V_{2009} &= \frac{FCF_{2010}}{r_{WACC} - g_{FCF}} \\
&= \frac{50}{9.4\% - 5\%} \\
&= 1136.36\end{aligned}$$ 
Expected value of firm in 2008:  
$$\begin{aligned} V_{2008} &= \frac{FCF_{2009}}{(1+r_{WACC})^1}+ \frac{V_{2009}}{(1+r_{WACC})^1} \\
&= \frac{45}{1+9.4\%}+ \frac{1136.36}{1+9.4\%} \\
&= 1079.85\end{aligned}$$ 
Expected stock price in 2008:  
$$\begin{aligned} P_0 &= \frac{V_0 + \text{cash}_0 - \text{debt}_0}{\text{# of shares}} \\
&= \frac{1079.85 + 110 - 30}{50} \\
&= 23.2\end{aligned}$$ 

## CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)

textbook P379

### CAPM Assumptions

- Buy and sell all securities without taxes or transactions costs 
- Borrow and lend at the risk-free interest rate
- Hold only (efficient) portfolios that yield the maximum expected return for volatility
- Homogeneous expectations

### Risk and Return

- Expected Return: $E[R] = \sum Pr(R) \cdot R$ 
- Excess Return: $E[R] - r_f$ 
- Variance: $$\begin{aligned} Var(R) &= E\left[\big(R - E[R]\big)^2\right] \\ &= \sum Pr(R) \cdot \big(R - E[R]\big)^2\end{aligned}$$ 
- Standard Deviation: $SD(R) = \sqrt{Var(R)}$ 
- Realized Return (remember [Equity Cost of Capital](#dividend-discount-model)): 
$$\begin{aligned} R_{t+1} &= \frac{Div_{t+1} + P_{t+1}}{P_t} - 1 \\ &= \underbrace{\frac{Div_{t+1}}{P_t}}_{\text{Dividend Yield}}+\underbrace{\frac{P_{t+1}-P_t}{P_t}}_{\text{Capital Gain Rate}}\end{aligned}$$ 
- Realized Annual Return: $$1+R_{year} = (1+R_{Q1})(1+R_{Q2})(1+R_{Q3})(1+R_{Q4})$$ 
- Average / Historical Annual Return: $$\begin{aligned} \bar{R} &= \frac{1}{T}(R_1+R_2+\cdots +R_T) \\ &= \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T R_t\end{aligned}$$ 
- Estimated Variance: $$Var(R) = \frac{1}{T-1}\sum_{t=1}^T (R_t - \bar{R})^2$$ 
- Standard Error: standard deviation of the average return  
$$SE = \frac{SD}{\sqrt{\text{# of observations}}}$$ 
- Covariance between two stocks: 
$$Cov(R_i,R_j) = E\left[\big(R_i - E[R_i]\big)\big(R_j - E[R_j]\big)\right]$$ 
- Estimated Covariance: 
$$Cov(R_i,R_j) = \frac{1}{T-1}\sum_{t=1}^T (R_{i,t} - \bar{R}_i)(R_{j,t} - \bar{R}_j)$$ 
- Correlation: $$Corr(R_i,R_j) = \frac{Cov(R_i,R_j)}{SD(R_i)\cdot SD(R_j)} \in [-1,1]$$ 

> PS.10-14  
> How does the relationship between the average return and the historical volatility of individual stocks differ  
> from the relationship between the average return and the historical volatility of large, well-diversified portfolios?

For large portfolios, higher returns is often associated with higher volatilities.  
For stocks, no clear relation exists.

### Risk Measurement and $β$

- Market Portfolio $\subset$ Efficient Portfolios: cannot be further diversified 
- $β$ of Stock: expected % change in its return given a 1% change in the return of the market portfolio 
$$β_i = \frac{Cov(R_i,R_{market})}{Var(R_{market})}$$ 
- Market Risk Premium (ratio): the risk premium investors earn by holding market risk 
$$\text{Market Risk Premium} = E[R_{market}] - r_f$$ 
- CAPM Cost of Capital (of Investment) = SML (Security Market Line): 
$$\begin{aligned} r_I &= r_f + β_I \cdot \text{Market Risk Premium} \\
&= r_f + β_I \cdot \left(E[R_{market}] - r_f \right)\end{aligned}$$ 

> PS.10-23  
> Explain why the risk premium of a stock does not depend on its diversifiable risk.

By diversifying, diversifiable risk can be costlessly removed from a portfolio.

> Your investment portfolio consists of $15,000 invested in only one stock—Microsoft.  
> Suppose the risk-free rate is 5%, Microsoft stock has an expected return of 12% and a volatility of 40%,  
> and the market portfolio has an expected return of 10% and a volatility of 18%.

> What is the expected return of this investment?

1. Let the expected return be  
$$\begin{aligned} E[R_{MS}] &= r_f + x\cdot (E[R_{market}] - r_f) \\
12 \% &= 5\% + x\cdot (10\% - 5\%) \\
x &= 140\%\end{aligned}$$ 
Therefore, same expected return can be achieved by borrowing $15000\times 40\% = 6000$ and investing $21000$ into market portfolio.  
Volatility:  
$$\begin{aligned} SD(R_{x,market}) &= x\cdot SD(R_{market}) \\
&= 140\% \times 18\% \\ &= 25.2\% \end{aligned}$$ 
2. Let the volatility be  
$$\begin{aligned} SD(R_{MS}) &= x\cdot SD(R_{market}) \\
40\% &= x\cdot 18\% \\
x &= 222\%\end{aligned}$$ 
Therefore, same volatility can be achieved by borrowing $15000\times 122\% = 18300$ and investing $33300$ into market portfolio.  
Expected return:  
$$\begin{aligned} E[R_{x,market}] &= r_f + x\cdot (E[R_{market}] - r_f) \\
&= 5\% + 222\%\cdot (10\% - 5\%) \\ &= 16.1\%\end{aligned}$$ 

## Capital Structure

### Perfect Capital Market Assumptions

- no bankruptcy / financial distress costs
- no tax / transaction costs
- corporate investment decisions not influenced by financing choices
- information available to all investors
- equal access to all security markets
- Modigliani-Miller's Irrelevance Theorem (MM) 
    - in perfect capital markets, total value of a firm does not depend on capital structure 
    - cost of capital of levered equity increases with the firm's market value debt-equity ratio

### Finance A Firm

- Unlevered Equity: finance with equity (stock) alone 
- Levered Equity: finance with equity (stock) and debt (bond) 
    - Debt holders get paid before euity holders
    - Leverage increases the risk of equity
- Homemade Leverage: investors borrow / lend + invest to adjust the leverage

> PS.14-3  
> Acort Industries owns assets that will have an 80% probability of having a market value of $50 million in one year.  
> There is a 20% chance that the assets will be worth only $20 million.  
> The current risk-free rate is 5%, and Acort’s assets have a cost of capital of 10%.  
> 1. If Acort is unlevered, what is the current market value of its equity?  
> 2. Suppose instead that Acort has debt with a face value of $20 million due in one year.  
> According to MM, what is the value of Acort’s equity in this case?  
> 3. What is the expected return of Acort’s equity without leverage? What is the expected return of Acort’s equity with leverage?  
> 4. What is the lowest possible realized return of Acort’s equity with and without leverage?

1. Current value of equity:  
$$\begin{aligned} PV &= \frac{FV}{1+r} \\ &= \frac{80\%\times 50 + 20\%\times 20}{1+10\%} \\ &= 40\end{aligned}$$ 
2. Current value of debt:  
$$\begin{aligned} PV &= \frac{FV}{1+r_f} \\ &= \frac{20}{1+5\%} \\ &= 19.05\end{aligned}$$ 
Current value of equity:
$$40 - 19.05 = 20.95$$ 
3. Expected return w/o leverage: $\frac{44}{40} - 100\% = 10\%$  
Expected return with leverage: $\frac{44-20}{20.95} - 100\% = 14.55\%$  
4. Lowest possible realized return w/o leverage: $\frac{20}{40} - 100\% = -50\%$  
Lowest possible realized return with leverage: $\frac{20-20}{20.95} - 100\% = -100\%$

### Leverage and Risk

- $E + D = U = A$ 
    - $E$: equity
    - $D$: debt
    - $U$: unlevered equity
    - $A$: assets
    - Debt-to-Value Ratio: $\frac{D}{E+D}$
- Cost of Capital (unlevered) = Pre-Tax WACC: $$r_U = \frac{E}{E+D}r_E + \frac{D}{E+D}r_D$$ 
- Cost of Capital (levered): $$r_E = r_U + \frac{D}{E}(r_U - r_D)$$ 
- Unlevered $β$: $$β_U = \frac{E}{E+D}β_E + \frac{D}{E+D}β_D$$
- Levered $β$: $$β_E = β_U + \frac{D}{E}(β_U - β_D)$$

> PS.14-10  
> Explain what is wrong with the following argument:  
> "If a firm issues debt that is risk free, because there is no possibility of default, the risk of the firm’s equity does not change.  
> Therefore, risk-free debt allows the firm to get the benefit of a low cost of capital of debt without raising its cost of capital of equity."

Any leverage raises the equity cost of capital.  
Since risk-free leverage does not share any risk from the firm, it raises it the cost of capital the most. 

> Mock.I.Q3  
> Assume that capital markets are perfect.  
> You have the following information concerning the equity and debt betas, as well as the debt to equity ratio in your firm:  
> equity beta = $1.15$; debt beta = $0$; debt-to-equity Ratio = $0.25$.  
> What is the unlevered beta of your firm?

Unlevered beta: 
$$\begin{aligned} β_U &= \frac{E}{E+D}β_E + \frac{D}{E+D}β_D \\
&= \frac{4}{1+4}\times 1.15 + \frac{1}{1+4}\times 0 \\
&= 0.92\end{aligned}$$ 

## Debt and Tax

### Interest Tax Shield

- tax savings from debt
- $\text{interest tax shield} = \text{tax rate}\times\text{interest payments}$
- with interest tax shield, total value of the levered firm exceeds the value of the firm without leverage
    - $\text{interest tax shield} = V^L - V^U$
- PV of interest tax shield (constant tax rate + permanent debt): 
$$\begin{aligned} PV(\text{interest tax shield}) &=\frac{τ\cdot (r_f\cdot D)}{r_f} \\ &= τ\cdot D\end{aligned}$$ 
- WACC with interest tax shield: 
$$\begin{aligned} r_{WACC} &= \frac{E}{E+D}r_E + \frac{D}{E+D}r_D(1-τ) \\ &= \underbrace{\frac{E}{E+D}r_E + \frac{D}{E+D}r_D}_{\text{Pre-Tax WACC}} - \underbrace{\frac{D}{E+D}r_D\cdot τ}_{\text{interest tax shield}}\end{aligned}$$

1. Total value of the firm: $30\times 15+150 = 600$  
Pretax weighted average cost of capital:  
$$\begin{aligned} r_{WACC} &= \frac{E}{E+D}r_E + \frac{D}{E+D}r_D \\
&= \frac{30\times 15}{600}\times 10\% + \frac{150}{600}\times 5\% \\
&= 8.75\% \end{aligned}$$ 
2. After-tax weighted average cost of capital:  
$$\begin{aligned} r_{WACC} &= 8.75\% - \frac{D}{E+D}r_D\cdot τ \\
&= 8.75\% - \frac{150}{600}\times 5\%\times 35\% \\ &= 8.3125\%\end{aligned}$$

> If Flagstaff currently maintains a 0.5 debt to equity ratio, what is then the value of Flagstaff’s interest tax shield?

Pre-tax WACC:  
$$\begin{aligned} WACC &= \frac{E}{E+D}r_E + \frac{D}{E+D}r_D \\
&= \frac{2}{1+2}13\% + \frac{1}{1+2}7\% \\
&= 11\%\end{aligned}$$ 
Value of the firm: 
$$\begin{aligned}V^U &= \frac{FCF_{n+1}}{WACC - g} \\ &= \frac{8}{11\% - 3\%} \\ &= 100 \end{aligned}$$ 
After-tax WACC:  
$$\begin{aligned} WACC &= 11\% - \frac{D}{E+D}r_D\cdot τ \\ &= 11\% - \frac{1}{1+2}7\%\times 35\% \\ &= 11\% - 0.816\% \\ &= 10.18\%\end{aligned}$$ 
Value of the firm: 
$$\begin{aligned}V^L &= \frac{FCF_{n+1}}{WACC - g} \\ &= \frac{8}{10.18\% - 3\%} \\ &= 111.42\end{aligned}$$ 
Tax shield: 
$$V^L - V^U = 111.42 - 100 = 11.42$$

1. WACC:  
$$\begin{aligned} r_{WACC} &= \frac{E}{E+D}r_E + \frac{D}{E+D}r_D(1-τ)\\
&= \frac{1}{1+0.4}\times 11.3\% + \frac{0.4}{1+0.4}\times 5\%\times (1-35\%) \\
&= 9\%\end{aligned}$$ 
PV of earnings: $\frac{C}{r-g} = \frac{0.75}{9\%-4\%} = 15$  
NPV: $15 - 10 = 5$  
2. $15 \times\frac{0.4}{1+0.4} = 4.28$  
3. Pre-Tax WACC: 
$$\begin{aligned} r_{WACC} &= \frac{E}{E+D}r_E + \frac{D}{E+D}r_D\\
&= \frac{1}{1+0.4}\times 11.3\% + \frac{0.4}{1+0.4}\times 5\% \\
&= 9.5\%\end{aligned}$$ 
Pre-Tax PV of earnings: $\frac{C}{r-g} = \frac{0.75}{9.5\%-4\%} = 13.64$  
Interest tax shield: $15-13.64 = 1.36$

### Personal Tax

- Debt holder: tax on interest income $$(1-τ_i)$$ 
- Equity holder: (corporate tax) + tax on equity income $$(1-τ_c)(1-τ_e)$$ 
- Effective Tax Advantage of Debt: $$\begin{aligned} τ^* &= \frac{(1-τ_i)-(1-τ_c)(1-τ_e)}{(1-τ_i)} \\ &= 1-\frac{(1-τ_c)(1-τ_e)}{(1-τ_i)} \\ &\leq τ_c\end{aligned}$$

1. $τ_i = 35\%$, $τ_c = 40\%$, $τ_e = 15\%$  
Return for risk-free debt: $6\%\cdot(1-τ_i) = 6\% \times (1-35\%) = 3.9\%$  
Set the return for preferred stock at $3.9\%$, cost of capital for risk-free preferred stock:  
$$\frac{3.9\%}{1-τ_e} = \frac{3.9\%}{1-15\%} = 4.59\%$$ 
2. After-tax debt cost of capital:  
$$\begin{aligned} 6\% \times (1-τ_c) &= 6\% \times (1-40\%) \\ &= 3.6\% \\ &< 4.59\% \end{aligned}$$ 
Therefore, debt is cheaper.  
3. $$\begin{aligned} τ^* &= 1-\frac{(1-τ_c)(1-τ_e)}{(1-τ_i)} \\ &= 1-\frac{(1-40\%)(1-15\%)}{(1-35\%)} \\ &= 21.54\%\end{aligned}$$ 
$$\begin{aligned} 4.59\%\times (1 − τ^*) &= 4.59\%\times (1-21.54\%) \\ &= 3.6\%\end{aligned}$$

1. $85000\times\left(1-\frac{1}{4}\right) = 63750$  
2. Offer A:  
$$85000+\frac{85000}{1+5\%} = 165952$$ 
Offer B:  
$$\begin{aligned} &90000 + 50\%\times \frac{90000}{1+5\%} + 50\%\times \frac{63750}{1+5\%} \\
= \ &90000 + 50\%\times 85714 + 50\%\times 60714 \\

1. Project A: $75$  
Project B: $50\%\times 140 + 50\%\times 0 = 70$  
Project C: $10\%\times 300 + 90\%\times 40 = 66$

- American Option: can exercise on any date before (including) the expiration date
- European Option: can exercise only on the expiration date
- Buyer = Holder = Long Position = has the option to exercise
- Seller = Writer = Short Position = has the obligation to fulfill
- Price of option is always positive
    - Long investor can only receive money at expiration
    - Short investor can only pay money

|                  | Stock Price & Option Price |

> PS.20-18, Mock.I.Q2  
> You happen to be checking the newspaper and notice an arbitrage opportunity.  
> The current stock price of Intrawest is $20 per share and the one-year risk-free interest rate is 8%.  
> A one year put on Intrawest with a strike price of $18 sells for $3.33, while the identical call sells for $7.  
> Explain what you must do to exploit this arbitrage opportunity. Provide calculations.

### Put-Call Parity 

- Option Portfolio Insurance
    - hold stock + buy put option
    - hold bond + buy call option
- Strike Price $K$: the price we want to insure that the stock will not drop below
- Call Price $C$
- Put Price $P$
- Stock Price $S$
- Intrinsic Value: $S-K$
- Put-Call Parity gives: 
$$\begin{aligned} \underbrace{S + P}_{\text{stock & put}} &= \underbrace{PV(K) + PV(Div) + C}_{\text{bond & call}} \\ \underbrace{C}_{\text{European call}} &= P + S - PV(K) - PV(Div)\end{aligned}$$ 

|                                    | Call Value (buy an asset) | Put Value (sell an asset) |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Long at Expiration (buyer, holder) | $C = \max(S-K, \ 0)$      | $P = \max(K-S, \ 0)$      |
| Short (seller, writer)             | $-  \max(S-K, \ 0)$       | $-\max(K-S, \ 0)$         |

### Early Exercise (American)

|              | Call                                                         | Put                                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| non-dividend | $C = S-K + \underbrace{dis(K) + P}_{\text{time value}>0}$    | $P = K-S + \underbrace{C-dis(K)}_{\text{time value}\lessgtr 0}$ |
|              | (no)                                                         | (maybe)                                                      |
| dividend     | $C = S-K + \underbrace{dis(K) + P - PV(Div)}_{\text{time value}\lessgtr 0}$ | $P = K-S + \underbrace{C-dis(K) + PV(Div)}_{\text{time value}> 0}$ |
|              | (maybe)                                                      | (usually no)                                                 |

> PS.20-23  
> Explain why an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock always has the same price as its European counterpart.

Since exercising early is worthless, the American option provides no more benefits than its European counterpart.

### Binomial Option Pricing Model 

- Number of stock: $Δ$ 
- Position in the bond: $B$ 
$$\begin{aligned} C_u &= S_u\cdot Δ + (1+r_f)\cdot B \\ C_d &= S_d\cdot Δ + (1+r_f)\cdot B \end{aligned}$$ 
$$\begin{aligned} Δ &= \frac{C_u - C_d}{S_u - S_d} \\ B &= \frac{C_d - S_d\cdot Δ}{1+r_f}\end{aligned}$$ 
- Call Price: $C = S\cdot Δ + B$ 

| 0    | 1     |      |       |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
|      | Stock | Bond | Call  |
| $S$  | $S_u$ |      | $C_u$ |
|      | $S_d$ |      | $C_d$ |

> PS.21-3  
> The current price of Natasha Corporation stock is $6.  
> In each of the next two years, this stock price can either go up by $2.50 or go down by $2.  
> The stock pays no dividends.  
> The one-year risk-free interest rate is 3% and will remain constant.  
> Using the Binomial Model, calculate the price of a two-year call option on Natasha stock with a strike price of $7.

| 0    | 1     | 2     |                      |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | -------------------- |
|      | Stock | Stock | Call                 |
| 6    | 8.5   | 11    | $\max (11-7,0) = 4$  |
|      |       | 6.5   | $\max (6.5-7,0) = 0$ |
|      | 4     | 6.5   | $\max (6.5-7,0) = 0$ |
|      |       | 2     | $\max (2-7,0) = 0$   |

Up state:  
$$\begin{aligned} Δ &= \frac{C_u - C_d}{S_u - S_d} \\
&= \frac{4 - 0}{11 - 6.5} \\ &= 0.889\end{aligned}$$ 
$$\begin{aligned} B &= \frac{C_d - S_d\cdot Δ}{1+r_f} \\
&= \frac{0 - 6.5\cdot 0.889}{1+3\%} \\ &= −5.61\end{aligned}$$ 
$$\begin{aligned} C &= S\cdot Δ + B \\
&= 8.5\cdot 0.889 − 5.61 \\ &= 1.95\end{aligned}$$ 
Down state: 0  
Whole portfolio:  
$$\begin{aligned} Δ &= \frac{C_u - C_d}{S_u - S_d} \\
&= \frac{1.95 - 0}{8.5 - 4} \\ &= 0.433\end{aligned}$$ 
$$\begin{aligned} B &= \frac{C_d - S_d\cdot Δ}{1+r_f} \\
&= \frac{0 - 4\cdot 0.433}{1+3\%} \\ &= −1.68\end{aligned}$$ 
$$\begin{aligned} C &= S\cdot Δ + B \\
&= 6\cdot 0.433 − 1.68 \\ &= 0.92\end{aligned}$$

> Hema Corp. is an all equity firm with a current market value of $1000 million (i.e., $1 billion), and will be worth $900 million or $1400 million in one year.  
> The risk-free interest rate is 5%. Suppose Hema Corp. issues zero-coupon, one-year debt with a face value of $1050 million, and uses the proceeds to pay a special dividend to shareholders.  
> Assuming perfect capital markets, use the binomial model to answer the following:  
> 1. What are the payoffs of the firm’s debt in one year?  
> 2. What is the value today of the debt today?  
> 3. What is the yield on the debt?  
> 4. Using Modigliani-Miller, what is the value of Hema’s equity before the dividend is paid?  
> What is the value of equity just after the dividend is paid?
